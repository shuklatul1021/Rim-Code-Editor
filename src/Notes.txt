Turn OFF the ECHO flag only, and keep all other terminal settings unchanged.

That’s it.


What TCSAFLUSH means (plain English)

Apply the new terminal settings, and discard (flush) any input that the user typed but the program has not read yet.


iscntrl() tests whether a character is a control character. Control characters are nonprintable characters that we don’t want to print to the screen. ASCII codes 0–31 are all control characters, and 127 is also a control character. ASCII codes 32–126 are all printable. (Check out the ASCII table to see all of the characters.)
